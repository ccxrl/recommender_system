This repository contains two Python scripts demonstrating basic approaches to building a recommendation system using the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset.

Rule-Based Recommender: A simple script that suggests content based on fixed, hard-coded rules (e.g., recently added, specific ratings).
Content-Based Recommender: A more advanced script that suggests content similar to a user's "seed" item, based on textual features like descriptions and genres.

And, it also contains the netflix_titles dataset to be used for the recommender.
